List any of the apis that we have used:


List the javascript libraries that are unique

ETL - Transform step:
What data was put into Mongodb with any changes or cleaning
what data was used in realtime
what data was used with machine learning - hybrid or tensorflow libraries

ETL - Load
used api call in a python module to load mongo
had two databases with separate collections for use by team

used yfinance api call for historic data 

tensorflow data - in use with ##data


Data Exploration
Charts Used:
Heat map example: https://www.finscreener.org/map
Candlestick chart for single chart - historic data looking at .....
Bubble chart example: https://www.finscreener.org/map/bubble
When bubble chart is clicked - goes to https://www.finscreener.org/tmus-t-mobile-us-inc-3919i
histogram example for P/E of multiple stocks: https://www.finscreener.org/map/histogram/dj30

What you get


Listing of all the apis

List of the Flask api and git repo

Libraries used - beyond the standard libraries
Plotly, D3, etc...



Machine Learning steps:

Identify training set

Using Tensorflow or hybrid set [if applicable]

Chart the learning datasets after identified
Use heatmap to show if correlation exists, use boxplot for outlier plotting, Use line graph for prediction results

Hypothesis:
Can constructs show a statistically significant result that predicts whether a stock, market sector or index will go up or down using 100 days of data.



Showing results - show line chart of predictions on one page; show a form that will allow user to input their data for same ML construct to see what results are given
