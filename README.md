# Project-02

Notebooks folder has examples to compute RSI [Relative Strenght Index]  and MACD - there are two more examples that I will put in later tonight that can give a technical analysis of stock prices or volumes over time.

The urls that the notebooks came from are listed in the first block of the notebook file.  The examples are easy to read and understand
